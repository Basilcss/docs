# Flexbox

Basil includes several utility classes for easily applying `display: flex;` and its related properties:

- `.flex-row` and `.flex-col` change the flex direction.
- Additional classes are provided for controlling alignment along both axes: `.flex-row-justifyCenter`, `.flex-col-alignCenter`, `.flex-row-justifyBetween`, `.flex-col-justifyBetween`, etc.
- **.big:flex-row-between-center**: Like flex-row-between-center but only applied when viewport width is 764px or more.
- For larger screens (minimum width of 764px), the same functionality is available with the `.big:` prefix.
